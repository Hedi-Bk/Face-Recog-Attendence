# 🎯 Real-Time Face Attendance System with Firebase

A smart solution to automate attendance tracking using face recognition and cloud-based storage.  
No more manual attendance or long lists — just a camera and your face. 🔥

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

In conferences, workshops, or classrooms, tracking attendance manually is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project solves that by **automatically verifying and logging attendance using facial recognition**.

✅ **Efficient** – No manual attendance  
✅ **Real-time** – Live presence updates via camera  
✅ **Accurate** – Prevents duplicate attendance per day  
✅ **Scalable** – Works for any number of participants

## 🚀 Pipeline Overview

1. 📸 **Face Collection**  
   Authorized users provide a clear image of their face before the event.

2. 💾 **Image Storage**  
   The images are saved locally in the `images/` folder.

3. 🧠 **Face Embedding Generation**  
   We run `EncodeGenerator.py` to extract face embeddings using **FaceNet**.  
   These are stored in `EncodedFile.p` — one encoding per authorized user.

4. 🎯 **Live Face Detection & Matching**  
   During the event, the webcam scans faces in real time.  
   If a match is found, the presence is recorded in **Firebase Realtime Database**.

5. 🔒 **One Entry per Day Rule**  
   A person can only validate their presence **once per day**.  
   (For demo purposes, we used a 30-second interval instead.)

6. 📊 **Live Dashboard**  
   Presence data is displayed in real time via Firebase, making it easy to monitor attendance.
